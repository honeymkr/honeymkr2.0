How much longer do you plan keep on playing with tutorials? 
            Hundreds and thousands of other folks are buying and completing the same material
            which doesn't really make a difference.
            Have you notices that you prefer the tutorials which have the most positive reviews?
            Inbetween the minutes and hours of sitting there in front of your computer you keep 
            choosing to follow the same path to nowhere with your money and focus.
            Your thirst for survival is exactly what's in the way of you breaking out of the 
            predictable groove.
            Solitude is no solution. In fact, let's face it - it's depressing hoping that another great 
            program or video source will make any difference for you in creating
            the opportunity of your dreams.<a href="#work">awesome work</a>.

            What's missing is working with other real human beings who share many of the same 
            gaps in experience. What hiring managers are looking for is authentic drive to make something real happen
            without being stopped by your limitations.

            If you had the opportunity to grow in the same kind of environment as the startup or 
            company you wish to be a part of what would really be possible for you?
